# Automato
Automato is a LUA-based automation program which is useful for any automation task which primarily involves screen scraping and sending mouse clicks, with a special focus on automating video games.  Automato was originally called <i>Jimbly's VeggieTales</i>, as it was initially developed for growing vegetables in <i><a href="http://atitd.com">A Tale in the Desert</a></i>, but has grown to be used in other games as well.
